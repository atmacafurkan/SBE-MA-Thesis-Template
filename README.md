# Why LaTeX?
Linguistics students might need tailored representations for language structure, 
language specific characters etc. It is also the nature of linguistics to present expressions 
in the language examined, with aligned glossing. These glossings need to be aligned with the words. 
Common text editors do not allow for spacing words according to the glossing. 
Also cross referencing to these examples are cumbersome with GUI text editors.
LaTeX provides solutions for each of the needs of a linguistics student.
